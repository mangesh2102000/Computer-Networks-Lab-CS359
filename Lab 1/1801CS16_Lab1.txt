Problem1: Writing Wireshark filter expressions for packet capture

Write the exact packet capture filter expressions to accomplish the following:

1. Capture all TCP traffic to/from Facebook, during the time when you log in to your Facebook account
-> 
	Capture filter : tcp && host www.facebook.com

2. Capture all HTTP traffic to/from Facebook, when you log in to your Facebook account
/* I have captured HTTPS traffic as there is no HTTP traffic present
->
	Capture filter : tcp && host www.facebook.com
	Display filter : tcp.port == 443

3. Find a popular YouTube video and play it while capturing all traffic to/from YouTube
-> 
	Capture filter : host www.youtube.com

1. Write a DISPLAY filter expression to count all TCP packets (captured under item #1) that have the flags SYN, PSH, and RST set. Show the fraction of packets that had each flag set.
-> 
	Facebook IP : 69.171.250.35
	User IP : 192.168.43.143
	Total Packets Captured: 801 over 26.308 seconds

	// All TCP Packets with SYN flag set
	display filter : tcp.flags.syn==1     TCP Packets with SYN flag set : 0		Fraction of Total = 0

	// All TCP Packets with PSH flag set
	display filter : tcp.flags.push==1 	  TCP Packets with PSH flag set : 333	Fraction of Total = 333/801 = 0.41573

	// All TCP Packets with RST flag set
	display filter : tcp.flags.rst==1 	  TCP Packets with RST flag set : 0		Fraction of Total = 0


2. Use a DISPLAY filter expression to separate the packets sent by your computer vs. received from Facebook and YouTube in items #2 and #3 above. Show the fractions for each type.
-> 
	#2 ->
	Facebook IP : 69.171.250.35
	User IP : 192.168.43.143
	Total Packets Captured: 801 over 26.308 seconds

	Packets sent to facebook: 302			Display Filter: ip.dst==69.171.250.35    Fraction of Total = 302/801 = 0.377
	Packets received from facebook: 499		Display Filter: ip.dst==192.168.43.143   Fraction of Total = 499/801 = 0.623 

	#3 ->
	Youtube (Google) IP : 142.250.67.142
	User IP : 192.168.43.143
	Total Packets Captured : 514 over 94.234 seconds
	
	Packets sent to Youtube: 174			Display Filter: ip.dst==142.250.67.142   Fraction of Total = 174/514 = 0.3385 
	Packets received from Youtube: 340		Display Filter: ip.dst==192.168.43.143	 Fraction of Total = 340/514 = 0.6615


Problem2:- Captured Data Analysis

a. Count how many TCP packets you received from / sent to Facebook or YouTube, and how many of each were also HTTP packets.
/* I have check for HTTTPS packets as there are no HTTP packets present, For HTTP answer will be zero
-> 
	#Facebook
	Capture filter : tcp && host www.facebook.com

	Facebook IP : 69.171.250.35
	User IP : 192.168.43.143
	Total Packets Captured: 801 over 26.308 seconds
	
	TCP Packets sent to facebook: 302	
	Display Filter: ip.dst==69.171.250.35

	TCP Packets sent to facebook who were also HTTPS Packets = 302
	Display Filter: ip.dst==69.171.250.35 && tcp.port==443

	TCP Packets received from facebook: 499
	Display Filter: ip.dst==192.168.43.143

	TCP Packets received from facebook who were also HTTPS packets = 499
	Display Filter: ip.dst==192.168.43.143 && tcp.port==443


	#Youtube
	Capture filter : host www.youtube.com

	Youtube (Google) IP : 142.250.67.142
	User IP : 192.168.43.143
	Total Packets Captured : 514 over 94.234 seconds
	
	TCP Packets sent to Youtube: 174	
	Display Filter: tcp && ip.dst==142.250.67.142

	TCP Packets sent to Youtube who were also HTTPS Packets = 174
	Display Filter: tcp && ip.dst==142.250.67.142 && tcp.port==443  

	TCP Packets received from Youtube: 340		
	Display Filter: tcp && ip.dst==192.168.43.143

	TCP Packets received from Youtube who were also HTTPS packets = 340
	Display Filter: tcp && ip.dst==192.168.43.143 && tcp.port==443


b. Determine if any TCP packets with SYN or PSH flags set were sent from your host or received from Facebook/Youtube. 
-> 
	#Facebook 
	Capture Filter : tcp && host www.facebook.com

	Facebook IP : 69.171.250.35
	User IP : 192.168.43.143
	Total Packets Captured: 801 over 26.308 seconds

	TCP packets with SYN or PSH flags set sent to Facebook from host : 89
	Display Filter:  (tcp.flags.push==1 || tcp.flags.syn==1) && ip.dst==69.171.250.35

	TCP packets with SYN or PSH flags set recieved from Facebook : 244
	Display Filter:  (tcp.flags.push==1 || tcp.flags.syn==1) && ip.dst==192.168.43.143

	#Youtube 
	Capture Filter : host www.youtube.com

	Youtube (Google) IP : 142.250.67.142
	User IP : 192.168.43.143
	Total Packets Captured : 514 over 94.234 seconds

	TCP packets with SYN or PSH flags set sent to Youtube from host : 85
	Display Filter:  tcp && (tcp.flags.push==1 || tcp.flags.syn==1) && ip.dst==142.250.67.142

	TCP packets with SYN or PSH flags set recieved from Youtube : 111
	Display Filter:  tcp && (tcp.flags.push==1 || tcp.flags.syn==1) && ip.dst==192.168.43.143


c. Go flag-by-flag and count how many packets have tcp.flags.push set, then how many have tcp.flags.syn set, and finally, how many have tcp.flags.reset set
->
	#Facebook 
	Capture Filter : tcp && host www.facebook.com

	Facebook IP : 69.171.250.35
	User IP : 192.168.43.143
	Total Packets Captured: 801 over 26.308 seconds

	// All TCP Packets with PSH flag set
	display filter : tcp.flags.push==1 	  TCP Packets with PSH flag set : 333	

	// All TCP Packets with SYN flag set
	display filter : tcp.flags.syn==1     TCP Packets with SYN flag set : 0		

	// All TCP Packets with RST flag set
	display filter : tcp.flags.rst==1 	  TCP Packets with RST flag set : 0	


	#Youtube 
	Capture Filter : host www.youtube.com

	Youtube (Google) IP : 142.250.67.142
	User IP : 192.168.43.143
	Total Packets Captured : 514 over 94.234 seconds	

	// All TCP Packets with PSH flag set
	display filter : tcp.flags.push==1 	  TCP Packets with PSH flag set : 196

	// All TCP Packets with SYN flag set
	display filter : tcp.flags.syn==1     TCP Packets with SYN flag set : 0		

	// All TCP Packets with RST flag set
	display filter : tcp.flags.rst==1 	  TCP Packets with RST flag set : 0
